- 0.1.1 - 3/24/19:
  - Refactored several variables to be more explicit.
  - Additional code comments.
  - Changed versioning back to original release; instead of 1.0, now 0.1.0 to better reflect maturity of software; development pace.

  - Moved preset values into own function in separate file.
  - Added option to choose between presets and interactive mode.
  - Reenable interactive mode.
- 0.0.9 - 3/21/19:
  - This is what happens when you don't touch a codebase for a long time and then come back to it...Simplifying code to make it easier to build out again
  - Code no longer offers option to save plugins to individual files and get_page_of_results.py has been deprecated; may be recreated later.
  - wopas.py now includes preset values that allow bypassing interactivity; you'll need to comment out preset values and uncomment lines as instructed in wopas.py to reenable interactive mode.

- 0.0.5 - 5/13/18:
    - API request now asks that description and sections not be included in file, significantly decreases amount of data received.
    - WP.org API inconsistently returns dicts or lists, added code that detects what is being returned and converts to dict if necessary.

    - Added logic to place commas between JSON objects in a single file.
    - Added separate script that reads in the JSON file and outputs it without the versions info. This can be easily modified to remove any info. desired.
